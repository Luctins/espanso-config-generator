* What this is
Simple tool that I hacked together for generating espanso image matches from a directory where each subdirectory is a 'category'.

* How to use
To use, just put your files under: =~/.config/espanso/images/stickers/= with subdirectoryes for each category or change the variable on the Makefile.

I strongly recommend using =espanso cmd search= for expanding match, preferrably binding it to some global keyboard shortcut. it has fuzzy searching and lists the available matches by name.

* =TODO=
Not sure to be honest. It does exactly what I want for now.

Ideas are welcome though.
